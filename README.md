# Design-of-Series-Active-Filter-for-Power-Quality-Improvement-using-Simulink
In the modern electrical distribution system, power quality is one of the major issues. The power quality can be analyzed as voltage unbalance, voltage sag and swell, and partial or total loss of one or more phases. The voltage unbalance is mainly caused by the uneven distribution of single-phase loads which may continuously change across a three-phase system.

The lack of quality power can cause loss of production, damage to equipment or appliances, increased power losses, interference of communication lines, and so forth. The power system equipment and customer equipment such as overhead and underground cables, transformers and rotating electric machines, and protection systems, are also affected by poor-quality voltage. Passive filters have traditionally been used to mitigate distortion due to harmonic current in the industrial power sector. But they have many drawbacks such as resonance problems, dependency of their performance on the system impedance, and absorption of harmonic current of nonlinear load, which could lead to further harmonic propagation through the power system.

To overcome such problems active power filters are introduced. It has no such drawbacks as a passive filter. They inject harmonic voltage or current with appropriate magnitudes and phase angles into the system and cancel the harmonics of nonlinear loads. But it also has some drawbacks like high initial cost and high power losses which limit their wide application, especially with a high power rating system. The widespread use of power electronics-based equipment has produced a significant impact on the quality of electric power supply.

The increasing severity of harmonic pollution in power networks has attracted the attention of power electronics and power system engineers to develop dynamic and adjustable solutions to power quality problems. The unbalanced voltage can be compensated with the use of three- three-phase series active filter which regulates the voltage to the desired level.
